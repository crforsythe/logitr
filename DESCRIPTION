Description: logitr estimates multinomial (MNL) and mixed logit (MXL) models in R. Models can be estimated in "Preference" or "Willingness-to-pay (WTP)" space utility specifications. The program includes an option to run a multistart optimization loop with random starting points in each iteration, which is useful for non-convex problems like MXL models or models with WTP space utility parameterizations. The main optimization loop uses the nloptr function to minimize the negative log-likelihood function.
