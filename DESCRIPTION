Description: Estimation of multinomial (MNL) and mixed logit (MXL) models in R. Models can be estimated using "Preference" space or "Willingness-to-pay" (WTP) space utility parameterizations. An option is available to run a multistart optimization loop with random starting points in each iteration, which is useful for non-convex problems like MXL models or models with WTP space utility parameterizations. The main optimization loop uses the {nloptr} package to minimize the negative log-likelihood function. Additional functions are available for computing and comparing WTP from both preference space and WTP space models and for simulating the expected shares of a set of alternatives using an estimated model.
