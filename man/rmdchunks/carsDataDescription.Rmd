This example uses the [cars_us](https://jhelvy.github.io/logitr/reference/cars_us.html) data set from Helveston et al. [-@Helveston2015] containing 384 stated choice observations from US car buyers. Conjoint surveys were fielded in 2012 online in the US on Amazon Mechanical Turk and in person at the 2013 Pittsburgh Auto show. Participants were asked to select a vehicle from a set of three alternatives. Each participant answered 15 choice questions.

In the utility models described below, the data variables are represented as follows:
