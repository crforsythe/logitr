The `data.frame` provided to the `data` argument must be arranged in a particular way (i.e. "long" or ["tidy"](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html) format). Each row should be an alternative from a choice observation. The choice observations do not have to be symmetric (i.e. each choice observation could have a different number of alternatives). The data must include columns for each of the following arguments in the `logitr()` function:

1. `choiceName`: A dummy variable that identifies which alternative was chosen (`1` = chosen, `0` = not chosen).
2. `obsIDName`: A sequence of numbers that identifies each unique choice occasion. For example, if the first three choice occasions had 2 alternatives each, then the first 9 rows of the `obsID` variable would be .
3. `parNames`: The names of the variables that will be used as model covariates. For WTP space models, do **not** include the price variable in `parNames` - this is provided separately with the `priceName` argument.

The data sets included in this package all follow this format (e.g. the [yogurt](https://jhelvy.github.io/logitr/reference/yogurt.html) data set).
